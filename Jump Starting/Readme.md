## some things to note:
* Some vehicles will have dedicated connection points for the jumper cables
* *DO NOT TURN OFF THE VEHICLE THAT WAS JUMP STARTED* let it run and charge the battery
* After a vehicle has been jump started it should be taken in to have the battery tested and the alternator tested to identify any causes of the dead battery
* Make sure the jumper cables are not interfering with any moving parts

## Procedure
* park the vehicles close together, ideally nose to nose, but not touching
* Both vehicles should be off and in park
* red jumper to positive terminal of dead battery *THEN* to good battery's positive terminal
* back jumper to negative terminal of good battery *THEN* to a metal surface like a bolt on the dead car
* start the working car and let it run for a few minutes and rev it slightly
* start the dead car, may take a couple tries but don't keep trying continously
* once dead car starts disconnect cables in reverse order!
