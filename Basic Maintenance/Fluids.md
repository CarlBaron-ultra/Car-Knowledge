# Fluids
In general the most common fluid people think about in their vehicle is the engine oil

# Windshield washer fluid
Perhaps the easiest thing to do is check and add windshield washer fluid. Located in the engine compartment under the hood, look for a cap or lid that has a symbol representing a windshield. Then add fluid until it reaches the fill line. Depending on the time of year you should be using the appropiate fluid for the temperature, such as a fluid with a lower freezing temeperature in the winter.

# Engine coolant
**Important: DO NOT TOUCH OR ATTEMPT TO UNSCREW THE RADIATOR CAP WHEN THE ENGINE IS ON OR IS HOT**
Engine coolant keeps the engine running at optimal temperatures and will have corrosion inhibitors and biocides added.
* typically a mix of coolant/anti-freeze and water is used
* ratio of coolant to water will vary between makes and models
* will vary in color
* Not all coolant is the same. Check vehicle manufactuer's specs to confirm correct coolant type

# Automatic transmission fluid
* Typically red colored
* If it leaks you will know. (Large red puddle under car that looks like someone was murdered, will soak into concrete)
* Does not need to be replaced often typically somewhere over 50,000 miles consult owners manual for specifics 

# Brake fluid
Hydraulic fluid for the brake system
* Located in engine comparment in a translucent container, cap will have a stop sign like symbol on it
* red-ish color
* common types are DOT 3 or DOT 4 but check vehicle's owners manual for correct type.

# Power steering fluid


# Note
Ever notice a clear odorless liquid dripping from your car after you turn the engine off? Ussually from the front passenger side and on hot days with A/C ussage? This is water condensate from the A/C compressor its perfectly normal
