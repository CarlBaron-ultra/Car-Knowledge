In general the most common fluid people think about in their vehicle is the engine oil

# Windshield washer fluid
Perhaps the easiest thing to do is check and add windshield washer fluid. Located in the engine compartment under the hood, look for a cap or lid that has a symbol representing a windshield. Then add fluid until it reaches the fill line. Depending on the time of year you should be using the appropiate fluid for the temperature, such as a fluid with a lower freezing temeperature in the winter.
