# Air Filters
Nearly every if not all vehicles that one will encounter will have a device dedicated to filtering the engine intake air. And Some will even have an additional filter that handles air for the passenger cabin.

# Why they matter
In the case of the enginge air filter, over time it will get dirty which will lead to less air for engine. This will impact the performance of the engine in terms of power and fuel efficiency. For the cabin air filter it impacts the air quality of the passenger cabin as well as the performance of the climate control and windsheild defroster. If it gets clogged the performance of the airconditioning system and windsheild defroster will decrease.

# Does my car have a cabin air filter?
Not all cars do. When in doubt refer to your vehicles owner manual.

# How do I find the correct filters for my vehicle?
Typically in stores there will be large books that have that info for different makes and models, and sometimes the owners manual will also have that info. But on websites for autopart stores like advance auto or autozone there is also a search feature that will show the correct filter models for you vehicle.
