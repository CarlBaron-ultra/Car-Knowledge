# Air Filters
Nearly every if not all vehicles that one will encounter will have a device dedicated to filtering the engine intake air. And Some will even have an additional filter that handles air for the passenger cabin.

# Why they matter
In the case of the enginge air filter, over time it will get dirty which will lead to less air for engine. This will impact the performance of the engine in terms of power and fuel efficiency. For the cabin air filter it impacts the air quality of the passenger cabin as well as the performance of the climate control and windsheild defroster. If it gets clogged the performance of the airconditioning system and windsheild defroster will decrease.

# Does my car have a cabin air filter?
Not all cars do. When in doubt refer to your vehicles owner manual.

# How do I find the correct filters for my vehicle?
Typically in stores there will be large books that have that info for different makes and models, and sometimes the owners manual will also have that info. But on websites for autopart stores like advance auto or autozone there is also a search feature that will show the correct filter models for you vehicle.

# How often should I replace the filters?
Car manufacteurs typically outline the recommended intervals in the owners manual. But in actual practice it depends on driving conditions. Driving frequently in dusty environments or in urban environments with lots of air pollution will dirty the filters quickly. If engine power or fuel efficiency is noticible decreased that could be a indicator that the engine filter needs to be replaced. Visual inspections of the filters is also a good idea. But in general repalceing the filters once a year is not a bad idea.

# Where are the filters located?

## Engine filter
In the engine compartment look for a large hose that leads to a box, then to the engine. The filter is located inside this box which is typically secured by tabs or clips.

## Cabin filter
If your vehicle has one it is located behind the glove box
